# Caro-Autonomus-serving-robot
In an era of technology undertaking every single aspect of life, starting off internet, laptops, Siri, Alexa and autonomous vehicles. Mankind has been relying on robotics to perform dull and dangerous tasks in the industry for several years. Robotic systems have accordingly inevitably found their way into the consumer market. Robots at home, hospitals, restaurants and hotels have been dreamt of for many years and have been projected in movies like cooking, cleaning, serving food, etc. 

We have decided to tap into the ever-growing demand for autonomous assistance that helps businesses leverage their resources, hospitals enhance their patient experience, Hotels elevate their guest experience in hospitality and Restaurants stand out with unique customer service.

We're aiming to help the elders who live on their own,  providing them with a robot that reminds them of their medication, hands them out alongside any other objects that they request. We're keen on making them feel well taken care of. 
Catering to the market's continuous demand, we started working on Caro.
